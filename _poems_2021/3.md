title: chaque jour le soleil égorge son spectre
author: Amina Saïd
translator: Ashley Sniffen
poem: |
  chaque jour le soleil égorge son spectre
  et se lève dans son sang

  tout commencement dessine un cercle
  la mémoire mène à la mer des commencements
  la jetée est de pierre l’arbre d'exil
  j’aspire à l’horizon

  sur un fil de lumière
  je vais vers ce lieu qui est toi
  et ce qui fut advient

  une étoile danse sur le ciel de mon front
  l’oiseau en nous renaît de la rive de l’âme
  ta parole est tienne mienne est ma parole

  tu rejoins le lieu que je suis
  et le poème continue de s’écrire

  je vois ton visage et l’ombre sur ton visage
  comme le poème la souffrance se partage
  nous compatissons à l’arbre aux saisons
  trop brèves et à l’exil des saisons
  aux sourires et aux déchirements de la terre
  aux malheurs des hommes aux prières des femmes

  à nos voeux l’instant prend sa forme éblouie
  le temps s’efface tel un paysage
  nous vivons les deux moitiés de nos vies
  comme un voyage qui se souviendrait peut-être
  du nom des îles des oiseaux des ports
  du sillage blanc des navires des villes des êtres
  du cycle des arrivées et des départs

  et nous tombons amoureux de la nuit
  parce que chaque nuit célèbre les noces du rêve
  et nous tombons amoureux du jour
  parce que la vie commence avec chaque jour
transpoem: |
  each day the sun slits the throat of its former self
  and rises in its blood

  each beginning represents a circle
  a memory leads to a sea of possibilities
  a pier is made of rock a tree of exile
  i yearn for the horizon

  on a thread of light
  i proceed towards this place that is you
  and what was begins again

  a star dances on the sky that is my forehead
  the bird within us is reborn from the nest of our soul
  your word is yours mine is my own

  you return to the place that I am
  and the poem begins to write itself

  i see your face and the shadow on your face
  like a poem your suffering is shared
  we share the grief of a withering tree
  too brief and at the mercy of the seasons
  of the smiles and of the rifts of the earth
  of men's misfortunes of women's prayers

  with our wishes a moment takes its dazzled form
  time fades like a landscape
  we live the two halves of our lives
  as if on a journey we perhaps remember
  the name of islands of birds of ports
  of the white wake of boats of cities of beings
  of the cycle of arrivals and of departures

  and we fall in love with the night
  because each night celebrates a dream's wedding
  and we fall in love with the day
  because life begins with each day

      I have loved the poems of Amina Saïd since I discovered her during my first
      year of college three years ago. Her rawness and directness comfort me; she
      employs common language and a lack of punctuation, which enable the reader
      to grapple directly with each word on the page. This poem is one of my
      absolute favorites, for it is easy to fall in love with the first line; the
      evocative imagery jumps out at the reader, forcing her to come to terms
      with a violent, self-destructive sun and its rebirth after tragedy each
      day. This concept forces us to consider the essence of life, of our own
      regeneration with the coming and going of each day. I chose to translate
      "égorge son spectre" as "slits the throat of its former self" instead of
      "slits the throat of its ghost" in order to convey a sense of rebirth and
      regeneration of the sun as its own entity or "former self." I wanted to
      delineate the poem's first line, which also serves as its title, as
      evocative of the essence of a phoenix being reborn from ashes, and
      therefore believe the indication of "former self" is necessary in order to
      distinguish between a sense of the past and of the present.
  </p>
  <p>
      With the line "each beginning represents a circle," I chose to translate
      the French <em>dessine</em> ("to draw") in a more symbolic manner in order
      to underscore the symbolism of a circle as representative of a beginning or
      of this feeling of rebirth that the first line of the poem conveys. In this
      manner, I chose the word "possibilities" in lieu of "beginnings" for the
      French <em>commencements</em> in the following line to emphasize the sense
      of possibility that is enabled through rebirth, which inherently
      constitutes a new beginning.
  </p>
  <p>
      Saïd shirks off any usage of punctuation or capitalization; it seems that
      in some portions of the poem, particularly 'and what was begins again,'
      might be better clarified by punctuation. However, I find the beauty in
      Saïd's poetry to underscore an ephemerality rooted within words and a
      constancy lodged within uncertainty. Saïd seems to be telling us that
      poetry and therefore life cannot be fully understood through generic
      formulas of punctuation, but rather through endeavoring to unravel the
      deeper meaning within a collection of words themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
      I felt calm when reading the second to last stanza, for I find solace in
      the repetition of the French word <em>de</em> ('of') for this repetition
      suggests the struggle of remembrance, of attempting to uncover past
      memories which are so inextricably tied to the present and the future that
      the lines of distinction are blurred. This repetition also mimics Saïd's
      signature rambling style, forcing the reader to consider the poem as a
      stream of consciousness that can apply to any person's experience of life
      and of the trials and tribulations involved with love, darkness, and light.
  </p>
  <p>
      Saïd juxtaposes notions of 'you' with 'me' in order to more fully arrive at
      the idea of an intertwining of souls, yet I believe that the beauty of this
      poem is more so discovered by ascertaining the connection of the individual
      self (or selves) with nature. By noting that 'we fall in love with the
      night' and 'we fall in love with the day,' she avails us to the beauty of
      life and the evocations of lightness and darkness imbued within it.

abio: "<p>Born in Tunis in 1953, Amina Saïd was raised bilingual, learning both Arabic
  and French in school and speaking Arabic, the language of her parents, at home.
  After being encouraged by her teacher, she began to write poetry in middle school
  and soon became enamored with the power of the written word to relate essential
  truths of being. She studied English in college and started to publish poetry soon
  after graduation. Saïd made a living as a journalist in France but continued to
  write throughout her life, ultimately publishing her work in numerous poetry collections
  and being considered as a unique voice based on her Tunisian heritage and experimentation
  with form.</p>"
