  醒                                                    马
          微                                   如
                    力                 飞
                               酒

transpoem: "Enjoy\nDusk                Flower\nAlready                        Come\nTime
  \                               Back\nWaking                                Horse\nSlightly
  \                       Like\nImpact                Flying\nWine\n\n\nA Chain Verse
  \n\nOutside, enjoying the flowers, then coming back\non a horse, running, running,
  almost flying.\nThe  sprightly horse seems like it's flying;\nthe impact of the
  wine \nis fading. My drunken\nfog is clearing; \nthe hour \nis already \nlate.\nWhen\n
  I woke, \nit was already dusk,\nand I've come back from enjoying the flowers. \n"

  <p>
      The original poem, an example of chain verses (<span lang= "{{ item.lang }}" dir="ltr">连环诗</span>) in ancient Chinese, is
      only fourteen characters long. This form of verse (<span lang= "{{ item.lang }}" dir="ltr">七言绝句</span>) is often
      twenty-eight characters long, with each line having seven characters. In
      this chain verse, the last three or four characters of each line are
      repeated in the next line, so the resulting poem requires only fourteen
      distinct characters. One fascinating feature of this poem is that in each
      line, the repeated characters often change parts of speech, slightly
      altering the meaning. For example, in the line "the impact of the wine is
      fading," the original word for "fading" means "becoming slight" (<span lang= "{{ item.lang }}" dir="ltr">微</span>), and in
      the next line, this word becomes an adverb (here translated as "slightly")
      that modifies the verb "waking" (<span lang= "{{ item.lang }}" dir="ltr">醒</span>), which we've translated in this context
      as "clearing." For the shape, we couldn't get it to form a diamond as in the
      original, due to the wordiness of English, so we formed it into an ancient
      Chinese wine goblet (<span lang= "{{ item.lang }}" dir="ltr">觚</span>, <em>gu</em>), hoping to convey some of the meaning of the poem through the form.
