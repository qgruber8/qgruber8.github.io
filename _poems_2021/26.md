poem: "A toute mes soeurs qui souffrent loin de moi \n\nFemmes africaines !\nFemmes
  de savanes et de la steppe ! \nFemmes des régions libérées ! \nFemmes de la Guinée
  Bissau, femmes d’Afrique ! \n\nVous avez aimé devant la rougeur de feux, \nSous
  le silence de l’ennemi, \nVous avez donné vie sous les crépitements des mitrailleuses\nVous
  les sœurs opprimées, vous qui gardez dans vos entailles \nLe visage de l’Afrique
  immortelle ! \nVous ne pourrez être oubliées, ni décolorées. \n\nVous avez nourri
  l’Afrique de votre sève\nVotre peau d’ébène a refusé la caresse du colonisateur.
  \n\nFemmes africaines ! \nBelles femmes à la peau sombre\nAcceptez la demande de
  votre sœur du Sénégal. \n\nBelles femmes noires \nAux destinées éternelles, \nEnrôle
  dans vos brigades\nJe mettrai l’uniforme du refus, \nJe participerai à vos simulacres\nDe
  combat, et je crierai : \n\nVIVE L’AFRIQUE LIBRE ! "
transpoem: "To all my sister who suffer far from me\nWomen of Africa! \nWomen of the
  Savanah and the Plain! \nWomen of the liberated regions! \nWomen of the Guinea-Bissau,
  women of Africa! \n\nYou have loved before the blush of fire, \nUnder the silence
  of the enemy, \nYou have given life under the sputter of machine guns, \nYou the
  sisters oppressed, you who guard in your womb, \nThe face of the immortal Africa!
  \nYou will not be neither forgotten, nor left to fade. \n\nYou have fed Africa from
  your lifeblood (sap, vital essence, life blood of life) \nYour skin of ebony refuses
  the caress of the colonizer. \n\nWomen of Africa! \nBeautiful women with dark skin
  \nAccept the request of your sister from Senegal. \n\nBeautiful black women \nTo
  your enteral destinies, \nEnlist in your brigades\nI will put on the uniform of
  refusal, \nI will participate in your mockery/sham simulacrum/false representation/
  poor imitation) \nOf combat, and I will cry: \n\nLONG LIVE THE LIBERATED AFRICA!

note: "<p>Three years ago, I translated the poem “Femme Noir” by Léopold Senghor for
  the 2018 edition of <em>DoubleSpeak</em>. When I found this poem by Ndiaye, I felt
  that it was a near perfect follow-up to my first translation, as it offers both
  a call to arms and love for Black women (specifically those from Africa) from the
  perspective of a Black woman. I tried my best to maintain the high-energy and fast-paced
  nature of the poem in my translation by keeping the lines to a similar length and
  retaining the same punctuation and structure. I also chose to translate all of the
  lines starting with <em>femme</em> as “Women of” to add repetition to the poem to
  keep it moving forward. I also tried to as closely as possible preserve the meanings
  of the more descriptive words like <em>crépitements</em>, which directly translates
  to “the crackling of machine guns.” However, I chose to use the word “sputter” in
  my translation because I felt it more accurately captured in English the sound she
  was trying to evoke. Similarly, while <em>ni decolorées</em> literally translates
  to “neither faded,” the line was difficult to translate as there is no meaningful
  English equivalent to this use of the past tense. I opted to use the phrase “left
  to fade,” as I believe it more accurately captures the feeling of the original line.
  Finally, I sifted through several different English translation of the line: “VIVE
  L’AFRIQUE LIBRE” (“long live free Africa,” “God bless free Africa,” etc.), but ultimate
  settled on translating <em>libre</em> as “liberated” as it felt like it carried
  the most nuanced understanding of what it means for Africa and Black women to be
  free.</p>"
